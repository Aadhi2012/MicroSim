This code solves the problem of precipitate growth using a multiphase field solver on the GPU.
The code is tested on Tesla P100 and Tesla V100.
For Tesla K80, one needs to comment "CudaMemPrefetchAsync" in solverloop/evolve.h

To run the code use 
1. "make" to create executable microsim_kks_cufft
2. Execute "./microsim_kks_cufft Input.in Filling.in Output"

The code uses CUDA version 11, CUFFT and CUDA-CUB libraries. 
nvcc version 11.2 is used for compilation of the codes.
Input.in contains all numerical and physical parameters used in the simulations. 
Makefile creates a  DATA folder where the datafiles (in the form of VTK files) are stored.
VTK files can be viewed using Paraview.

This is the alpha version of code. We will continue to add more features in future release.
