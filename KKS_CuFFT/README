This code solves the problem of precipitate growth using a multiphase field solver on the GPU.
The code is tested on Tesla P100 and Tesla V100.

To run the code use 
1. "make" to create executable kks.out
2. Execute "./kks.out Input.in Filling.in Output"

The code uses CUDA version 11, CUFFT and CUDA-CUB libraries. 

CUB may throw an error depending on the CUB version that is installed on your system.
This can be fixed simply by replacing the cub folder that is packaged with MicroSim,
with your system's copy of the installation.
This can be found either in /opt/cuda/targets/x86-64-linux/include or in
/usr/local/cuda/include, depending on your Linux distro.
However, CUB distributions for CUDA versions 11.2, 11.4, and 11.5 have been included
for convenience in the cub/ directory. They are numbered in order of release, and
can be switched simply by replacing the directory name in the cub include statement
in KKS_cuFFT.cuh

nvcc version 11.2 is used for compilation of the codes.
Input.in contains all numerical and physical parameters used in the simulations. 
Makefile creates a  DATA folder where the datafiles (in the form of VTK files) are stored.
VTK files can be viewed using Paraview.

This is the alpha version of code. We will continue to add more features in future release.
