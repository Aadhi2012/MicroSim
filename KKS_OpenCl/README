 *
 * OpenCL code for solidification microstructure evolution 
 * 
 * Compile the code using "make". Compilation creates "kim_soldfn.out" file. 
 * GEdata_writer.py is used for generation of Gibbs energy and its derivatives
 * To generate Gibbs energies and execute the program
 * run "./kimsldfn.sh  Input.in Filling.in Output"
 * It is always safe to run above command for execution of the code.
 *
 * If Gibbs energies are generated already then generating 
 * Gibbs energies can be skipped and directly execute following command.
 * Execute "./microsim_kks_opencl Input.in Filling.in Output" 
 * 
 * Authors: Dasari Mohan and G Phanikumar
 * Acknowledgement to P. Gerald Tennyson for contributions towards code development at IITM
 * 
 * This is alpha version of the code and check for updates in future release.
