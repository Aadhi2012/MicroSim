###  Python scripts to generate Composition and Hessian files in .csv format from the corresponding .dat files generated from PanDat

The python scripts have been tested for n-component alloy with 2 phases.
In these python scripts, the user needs to modify the following details:
- the input .dat filename
- output .csv filename
- the element and phase names in the order required in the output .csv files.

The example .dat files are also shared.
You may use any python IDE (eg. spyder) or run it directly from terminal.
